Project:  
`Flight Delay Insurance Dapp`

From Udacity:
> Learn to build a Dapp with multiple smart contracts which are autonomously triggered by external sources, and which handle payments based on flight delay scenarios.

Supporting courses:
* Advanced Blockchain Concepts and Oracles

`FlightSurety` is a decentralized application that offers flight delay insurance to airline passengers. This project is a learning exercise and will not be deployed to the Ethereum network. In short, mock oracles will provide flight status information to this Dapp and if a flight is delayed due to airline fault, passengers will be paid 1.5 times the amount they paid for the insurance. The dapp is managed as a collaboration between multiple airlines.
